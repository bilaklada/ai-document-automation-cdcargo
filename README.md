# 🧠 AI Document Automation for CD Cargo  

## 📘 Context & Motivation
Developed in 2025 as part of an applied AI automation project at **ČD Cargo**, this solution streamlines
document handling through intelligent workflows — eliminating manual extraction, validation and classification of RID reports.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an **end-to-end AI-driven document automation pipeline** built on the **Microsoft Power Platform**.
It integrates **AI Builder**, **Power Automate**, **SharePoint**, and **Outlook** into a unified system for document processing,
validation and data storage.

---

## 💡 Key Features  
- AI Builder–based document classification and field extraction.  
- Automated routing and approval workflows built in Power Automate.  
- Centralized SharePoint data management with full audit trail.  
- Seamless Outlook integration for automatic email ingestion.  
- Adaptive feedback loops for model retraining and continuous accuracy improvement.

## 🧱 Tech Stack  
| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-------------|
| **AI & Automation** | Microsoft Power Automate, AI Builder |
| **Data** | SharePoint, Excel Connectors |
| **Integration** | Outlook Connector, OneDrive |
| **Monitoring** | Power BI |

## ⚙️ Workflow Overview  
1. Outlook email with a PDF attachment triggers the Power Automate flow.  
2. AI Builder extracts structured data (e.g., RID number, date, carrier, amount).  
3. Extracted fields are written to a SharePoint list.  
4. Notification is sent for review and approval.  
5. Approved data becomes part of the reporting dataset.

---

## 📊 Results & Impact  
- Manual document processing time reduced by ~85%.  
- Improved accuracy and traceability through automation.  
- Enhanced cross-department data access and reporting visibility.  
- Fully automated inbound document handling.

---

## 🔍 Future Enhancements  
- Integrate **Azure OpenAI** for semantic validation.  
- Extend AI Builder models for multilingual templates.  
- Add **Power BI** dashboard for process analytics.
